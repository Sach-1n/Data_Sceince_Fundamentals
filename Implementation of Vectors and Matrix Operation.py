#   Program 2: Implement vectors and matrix operations using numpy, such as addition, subtraction,
#   multiplication, and inverse, transpose of the matrix.

import numpy as np

# Vector Operations
vector1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
vector2 = np.array([6, 7, 8])

# Dot product of Vectors
dotProduct = vector1.dot(vector2)
print(dotProduct)

# Scalar Multiplication
scalar = 10
sMul = vector1 * scalar
